                <p><strong>Dealers know that just as important as how the dealership looks, is how the dealership works. Ask yourself:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1. How do my customers and staff use my dealership for day-to-day activities?
                        </li>
                        <li>2. Can my sales team see the lot without obstruction?
                        </li>
                        <li>3. Do my customers have clear routes to the service area / workshop?
                        </li>
                        <li>4. Where is the guest bathroom located?
                        </li>
                        <li>5. How large does the showroom need to be to accommodate the number of cars we want to display?
                        </li>
                        <li>6. Given our planning volume and service growth goals, how many service bays do we need in the body shop? How many technicians?</li>

                        <p className="py-6"><strong>Traffic movement:</strong> This peaks at the start and end of the day, as vehicles are dropped off for servicing and delivery, and picked up</p>
                        <br />
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> The need to be highly visible on major transport routes, or close to town, may mean the proposed site is not in the correct local planning zones</p>
                        <br />
                        <p><strong>Lighting:</strong> The desire for the dealership forecourts to be illuminated for as long as possible. This is especially relevant in suburban locations</p>
                        <br />
                        <p><strong>Drainage:</strong> Adequate drainage facilities with the need for a trade effluent licence, interceptors, and treating waste products off-site.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, it is crucial that the customer has unobstructed views of the vehicles on display. From the dealership's point of view, it requires doors which allow easy access for new vehicles coming in and purchased vehicles going out, as well as vehicles coming in for servicing.</p>
                <br />
                <p> Not only that, but with larger car showrooms that contain a workshop for servicing, you may find that a standard roller shutter door just doesn’t cut it. Why?</p>
                <br />
                <p>Firstly your potential customers view is restricted, and secondly it’s important to remember the comfort of the mechanics working within your workshop. Compact sectional doors can contribute to a much more comfortable environment.</p>

                <p> Compact Sectional Door
                    Compact sectional doors are a bespoke access door which offers an alternative to bi-fold doors or tilt-up doors. They are available in a number of panel options:</p>
